{"pages":[{"title":"About me","text":"Read and you will discover what drives me. I am interested in science and technology and have an education in it. I love programming. I did it since I was a teenager. I wrote non-trivial stuff in assemblers, Basic, Pascal, C, C++, Perl, Python, Javascript and even some hardware description languages such as Verilog and VHDL. Music is my other love. From Abba to Bach. Maybe with opera as an exception.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/about-me.html"}]}
